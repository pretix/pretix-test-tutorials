pretix tutorial testing
=======================

This is a collection of Vagrant virtual machine definitions that can be used
to *test* that the instructions from the pretix tutorials still work. As they
use **insecure** hardcoded passwords and other unsafe defaults, **do not ever
even attempt to use them in production**. They are intended for internal use only.

How to run them
---------------

	cd <directory>
	vagrant up
